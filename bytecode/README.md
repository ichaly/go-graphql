# Bytecode query parser

This is a test to improve the query parsing and resolve speed.

Currently this is no-where used and still a WIP.

## How to understand it?

Currently the best way to understand the bytecode is to read:

- `bytecode_test.go` and `testing_framework.go` to see what query results in what bytecode
- `bytecode_instructions.go`
